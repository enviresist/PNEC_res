<h1>Mission and funding</h1>

<p>Antibiotics are drugs that either kill bacteria or inhibit their proliferation. However, even sub-lethal or sub-inhibitory concentrations of antibiotics select for drug-resistant bacterial phenotypes, aggravating the global crisis of antimicrobial resistance. The critical concentration above which selection for resistant phenotypes occurs is known as the minimum selective concentration (MSC). Lower-bound estimates of the MSC that account for variabilities within and across bacterial genera can serve as predicted no-effect concentrations regarding resistance selection (PNEC<sub>res</sub>).</p>

<p>This web page provides PNEC<sub>res</sub> estimates for a large suite of antibiotics currently used in human medicin. The presented material represents the outcome of a research project run by <a href="https://www.g-wt.de/en/" target="_blank">GWT</a> / the TU Dresden <a href="https://tu-dresden.de/bu/umwelt/hydro/hydrobiologie?set_language=en" target="_blank">Institute of Hydrobiology</a> with funding from the <a href="https://www.umweltbundesamt.de/en" target="_blank">German Environment Agency</a>.</p>
